### Project: Person Identification and Attributes Detection Using Hand Images

**Duration**: Apr 2023 - Jul 2024  
**Institution**: Associated with Allama Iqbal Open University

#### Project Overview:
This project leverages **machine learning** and **computer vision** to develop a CNN-based model for personal identification and attribute detection from hand images.

#### Key Features:
- Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for detecting personal attributes and identifying individuals using hand images.
- Implemented detection models for various attributes, including:
  - Accessories (e.g., rings)
  - Age and gender
  - Hand orientation (e.g., left or right)
  - Nail polish detection
  - Skin color classification
- **Deployed** the model using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions with a user-friendly interface.
- Utilized **Python** and **TensorFlow** for model development, training, and testing.

#### Tools & Technologies:
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Streamlit** (for deployment)
- **Computer Vision**
